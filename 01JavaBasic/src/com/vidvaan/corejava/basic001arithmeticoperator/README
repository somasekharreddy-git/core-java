About ::    We can use arithmetic operators to perform calculations with values in programs. 
Arithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the same way that they are used in algebra. 
A value used on either side of an operator is called an operand. 
For example, in below statement the expression 47 + 3, the numbers 47 and 3 are operands.
The arithmetic operators are examples of binary operators because they require two operands. 
The operands of the arithmetic operators must be of a numeric type. 
You cannot use them on boolean types, but you can use them on char types, since the char type in Java is, essentially, a subset of int.


   -----A holds 10 and variable B holds 20----


+	Addition - Adds values on either side of the operator	            :: A + B will give 30
-	Subtraction - Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand	:: A - B will give -10
*	Multiplication - Multiplies values on either side of the operator	:: A * B will give 200
/	Division - Divides left hand operand by right hand operand	        :: B / A will give 2
%	Modulus - Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and       :: B % A will give 0
    returns remainder
